  <h1>Project README</h1>

  <h2>General Description:</h2>
  <p>This project focuses on building a database system that explores the differences between the document-oriented and relational paradigms. The primary objectives include implementing CRUD operations, making design decisions for a document-oriented database, establishing associations between objects, and performing queries using Spring Data and MongoRepository.</p>

  <p>The project is designed to showcase the versatility and capabilities of a document-oriented database system, specifically MongoDB, and its integration with Spring Data for effective data management and retrieval.</p>

  <p>Developers will work with a sample database of users and posts, implementing features such as user profile management, post creation, and comments on posts. The project provides a practical demonstration of how to work with a NoSQL database for a variety of use cases.</p>

  <p>Users of this project can explore and learn about the key features and benefits of document-oriented databases and understand the scenarios where they outperform traditional relational databases.</p>

  <p>Feel free to explore the source code and documentation to gain insights into the design and implementation of this project.</p>
